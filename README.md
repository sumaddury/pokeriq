A micro-library intended for studying [No Limit Texas Hold'Em](https://thelodgepokerclub.com/no-limit-texas-holdem-rules-beginners-guide/) written in pure Python. 

The library provides classes and tools for toy games, simulations, and robust inductive equity calculations. It is intended for approximation and ease-of-use, rather than a replacement for more rigorous [Game Theory Optimal (GTO)](https://blog.gtowizard.com/what-is-gto-in-poker/) study.
